<h4>When a user first comes to the app, we're going to make a network request to an outside API and fetch a list of users and show them on the screen. </h4>

There is a button that can be clicked on to add in a new user (with a randomly generated name), next to every user there is a button that lets you delete that user. If you expand the first section it is going to display a list of photo albums that have been created by the user, and the album is a collection of different randomly generated photos. You can add more photos and also more albums to every user aswell.
